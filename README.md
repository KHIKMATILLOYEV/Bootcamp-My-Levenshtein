## Description of My-Levenshtein
This algorithm is designed to calculate the Quasar version of the Levenshtein number between two words. The Quasar version of the Levenshtein number is a value that reflects the degree of similarity between two given strings. In our case, we have simplified the concept of the Levenshtein number for the purposes of this exercise.
## Implementation
The algorithm of the Quasar version of the Levenshtein number is based on comparing two strings and returning the difference between them. Details of the algorithm implementation can be found in the file **my_levenshtein.js **.
